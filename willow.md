As part of my second year of university, I worked on a Systems Engineering group project. The group worked with [Seldon](http://www.seldon.io), a London-based machine learning startup, to create a web tool that can be used to pre-process data for use with machine learning.

## Background

Raw data collected from the real-world can be very **messy**, incoherent, and inconsistent. In most cases, the data have to be **pre-processed** to clean out inconsistencies within the data and have key features extracted before they can be used for machine learning. This process is often done **manually** using command-line tools and can take up a lot of time before any *real work* can be done on the data.

## Project Aim

Create a web tool with a graphical user interface that can:

- **Clean** and transform datasets
- **Analyze** datasets and give useful statistics
- **Visualize** dataset to help spot patterns

## Roles & Responsibilities

- **Deputy Group Manager** --- Assisted the group manager with allocating work and communicating with the client. 
- **UI Lead** --- In charge of designing and implementing the user interface of the system, making sure that it is easy to use and aesthetically pleasing. 
- **Chief Editor** --- Responsible for writing and editing documentation such as the user guide and the project website.

## Skills Developed

- Developing web applications using HTML, CSS, and AngularJS framework
- Working with Python modules including Pandas and scikit-learn
- Maintaining consistent code quality and collaborating with other group members
- Working in a professional manner with other group members as well as the client

## Project Outcome

The group worked on the project for 6 months and were wholly responsible for planning, coding, and communicating with the client. The final product was a web-app that allowed users to upload their datasets in CSV and Excel formats, and provided options such as filling in missing data, feature encoding, and discretization to clean the dataset. The application also provided a range of visualization and analytical features to help users to find patterns within the data.

Our client, Seldon, was extremely impressed with the product, praising especially it's user interface, and the product was featured in one of their blog posts. This project also achieved the highest mark out of the 40 or so projects of the same module.
