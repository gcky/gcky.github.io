One of my job as the Chief Editor for the Willow project was to create a website for the project which would be used to document the progress of the project as well as to provide support for users of Willow and other developers.

## Design Concepts

The website was split into two sections, one to document the progress of the project, the other to provide support and documentation. In order to create a clear distinction between the two sections intended for different audiences, different colour schemes were used. The layout, on the other hand, was kept similar to create a coherent appearance throughout the website.

The "cubes" symbol was used throughout the website and other documents related to the project. The cubes represented the vast amount of data collected for use in machine learning, and while they are no doubt valuable, they need to be organized in a special manner in order to actually be useful. This metaphor strengthens the aim of the project and creates a coherent theme across the website, the product, and other related materials.
