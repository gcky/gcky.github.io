## 1. TitleCase

One of the most unexpected yet annoying problem I encountered when writing for this blog is coming up with titles for the posts. I hope I will get better at it with more practice but one thing I don't need to practice on is deciding which letter to capitalise in the title. Thanks to the complexity of the English language, with all the exceptions and what not, I can never decide which letters to captialize in a title. Do I captialize _"is"_? What about _"to"_? [titlecase.com](http://titlecase.com) comes to the rescue, the website lets you paste in your title and it will capitalize the appropriate letters for you.
