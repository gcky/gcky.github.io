*The Next Station Is...* is a personal project where I visit every zone 1 & 2 stations on the London Underground, and create a video montage of the surrounding areas of each station. This project is still on-going. *(There are surprisingly many stations in zones 1 & 2.)*

## Background

In my third year studying at UCL, I moved to a place further away from the university campus and so had to get myself an annual travel-card for zones 1 and 2. It was *not* cheap and so I thought to myself why not use it more and explore places in London where I would never visit otherwise. So I went to the edges of zone 2, Clapham South, North Acton, Stratford..., and realized that while these places are all *inside* London, they can be very different from each other, some were busy, some were quiet; some were surrounded by high-rises and shopping malls, others by trees and fields. This was where the idea of capturing the atmosphere of these different places came to be.

## The Videos

The aim of these videos is to present and convey the atmosphere of the different places as accurately as possible. So little planning was done beforehand as to what particular shots I would like to take. These videos are not intended to be some sort of *"tourist guide"*, but rather a way for viewers to experience what it is like being at *that* place. There are no narration over these clips and to ensure that they are not too boring to watch, each montage is only around 5 minutes in length (there are exceptions). 

All clips were shot on my trusty Google Pixel in 4K, its excellent video stabilization feature was perfect for the task. The video montages were edited in Adobe Premiere Pro, where some audio effects and colour corrections were applied.

## The Website

Rather than having the videos just sitting inside a YouTube playlist, I decided to create a website to showcase the videos, as well as to provide a better experience for finding and watching the videos. The stations are arranged in tiles which has an still image of the video of that station as the background with the name and number of the station printed on top. This "tiles" idea came from collectibles like badges and stickers. I felt that it fitted in with the premise of the project where I go around London "collecting" these stations.
