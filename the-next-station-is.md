*The Next Station Is...* is a personal project where I visited every zone 1 & 2 stations on the London Underground, and created a video montage of the surrounding areas of each station. This project is still on-going. *(There are surprisingly many stations in zones 1 & 2.)*

## Background

In my third year studying at UCL, I moved to a place further away from the university campus and so had to get myself an annual travel-card for zones 1 and 2. It was *not* cheap and so I thought to myself why not use it more and explore places in London where I would never visit otherwise. So I went to the edges of zone 2, Clapham South, North Acton, Stratford..., and realized that while these places are all *inside* London, they can be very different from each other, some were busy, some were quiet; some were surrounded by high-rises and shopping malls, others by trees and fields. This was where the idea of capturing the atmosphere of these different places came to be.
