project_title: Referral App + Dashboard
---

In my first year of university study, I worked on an app development group project. The group worked with University College Hospital (UCLH) to develop a proof-of-concept patient referral system which included an iOS app as well as a web admin dashboard.

## Project Aim

Patients often get referred to different departments in the hospital. Currently, the referral process requires doctors to obtain relevant forms for the referring department, print out and fill the form, and finally scan and email the form to the relevant departments. This is a very time consuming process from both the doctors and the department administrators perspectives.

The project aimed to create a proof-of-concept referral system that would allow doctors to referral patients quickly using an iOS app. Doctors would fill in the forms digitally before sending them to the relevant departments, and the administrators would organize these referrals using a web interface.

## Roles & Responsibilities

- **Lead Programmer** - Tasked with developing the front-end components of the system including the iOS app and the web dashboard. 
- **UI Lead** - In charge of designing and implementing the user interface of both the iOS app and the web dashboard. 
- **Documentation Lead** - Responsible for writing and editing documentation such as reports for the client and technical documentation for the system.

## Skills Developed

- Developing a HTML based iOS application
- Creating a PHP web server to service referral requests with a MySQL database
- Using HTML and CSS to develop a web app

## Project Outcome

This project took 3 months to complete and the final product was an iOS app built using AppGyver's Steroids which allowed users to browse through the different forms as well as filling them in and sending the referrals to a MySQL database. The admin dashboard allowed admins to see, in a single place, relevant information of all the referrals as well as marking them as being processed.

Our client was very happy with the final product, expressing that it had exceeded their expectations. As a result, I received a first class mark (77%) for the work I have done in the project.
